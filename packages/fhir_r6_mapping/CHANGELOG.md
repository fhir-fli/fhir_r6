# fhir_r6_mapping

## [0.8.0]

- Carries the `memberOf` behavior change from fhir_r6_path ^0.8.0 — an invariant or expression using `memberOf` against a value set that cannot be resolved now throws rather than silently answering no. See the fhir_r6_path 0.8.0 entry
- fhir_r6 ^0.8.0

## [0.7.0]

- BREAKING: `MedicationrequestStatusBuilder` -> `MedicationRequestStatusBuilder` and `MessageheaderResponseRequestBuilder` -> `MessageHeaderResponseRequestBuilder` (with their `...BuilderEnum` companions), matching the core enum rename (GH fhir_r4#34). Old names remain as deprecated typedef aliases
- Web/WASM compatible transitively (fhir_r6_path 0.7.0 removed the last dart:io in the dependency chain)
- fhir_r6 ^0.7.0, fhir_r6_path ^0.7.0

## [0.6.0]

- Family lockstep 0.6.0; fhir_node dependency now declared explicitly
- FHIRPath host services migrated to the post-split fhirpath engine API
- xml constraint widened to '>=6.6.1 <8.0.0'
- README rewritten and verified against the API; analyzer clean

## [0.5.1]

- Improved documentation and README files

## [0.5.0]

* Unified versioning across all fhir_r6 packages
* Updated dependencies

## [0.4.0]

* First time publishing this. 
* Performs parsing of FHIR maps
* Performs application of FHIR maps

## [0.3.0]

* Most of the details are here https://fhir-fli.github.io/fhir_fli_documentation/docs

## [0.3.0-2]

* split back up into smaller packages, that seems to be how most people use it

## [0.3.0-1]

* Lots and Lots of changes.
* Once I get Mapping working properly, I'll create some actual documentation

## [0.2.0]

* Getting ready for FlutterCon!
* Updated dependencies
* Added documentation

## [0.1.0+2]

* Added ability to store versionIds as DataTimes instead of just integers (useful for syncing)
* Added a "sync" box in the Hive db. When turned on, saves all resources when updated, to allow easily finding them for syncing.
* Updated to work with updated primitives package (that has a lot more functionality with FhirBase)
* Added a deprecated parser to fhirpath for traversing tests

## [0.1.0+1]

* Overhaul. The packages were getting too big, and most people don't use all of them at the same time. So now, one package, all the functionality.
* Addressed [this issue](https://github.com/fhir-fli/fhir_at_rest/issues/2) pointed out by [fokusfpa](https://github.com/fokusfpa) - by just returning the OperationOutcome
* All FHIR dependencies should now be within this package.
* All dependencies updated except for collection, http_parser, and meta because there are some issues with the flutter version
