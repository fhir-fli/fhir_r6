# fhir_r6_validation

## [0.12.0]

- **The validator could not resolve anything, and now a caller can give it a store.** `FhirValidationEngine` built its own empty in-memory `CanonicalResourceCache` per call and offered no way to supply one, so `validateFhirMap` on any resource answered *"No StructureDefinition found for resourceType: X"*, and a resource with a coded element threw *"Resource not found at `<url>`"*. `validateFhirResource`, `validateFhirString` and `validateFhirMap` now take an optional `resourceCache`, which is used for every StructureDefinition, ValueSet and CodeSystem lookup. The package's own tests never caught this because they call the inner `validateStructure` with a test cache directly.
- **The base type is looked up by its canonical URL.** The engine asked its cache for the bare type name (`Patient`), which no cache keyed by `url` holds; a core type's definition is published at `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/<type>`. That URL is tried first and the bare name second.
- `client`, which the three entry points already accepted and silently ignored, is now passed to the default cache.

## [0.9.0]

- No code changes; version aligned with the fhir_r6 0.9.0 family release

## [0.8.0]

- Carries the `memberOf` behavior change from fhir_r6_path ^0.8.0 — an invariant or expression using `memberOf` against a value set that cannot be resolved now throws rather than silently answering no. See the fhir_r6_path 0.8.0 entry
- fhir_r6 ^0.8.0

## [0.7.0]

- Family release train: cores and companions released in lockstep at 0.7.0
- Web/WASM compatible transitively (fhir_r6_path 0.7.0 removed the last dart:io in the dependency chain)
- fhir_r6 ^0.7.0, fhir_r6_path ^0.7.0

## [0.6.0]

- Family lockstep 0.6.0
- Invariant evaluation migrated off the deprecated walkFhirPath to FHIRPathEngine
- Runnable example added; README rewritten and verified against the API; analyzer clean

## [0.5.1]

- Improved documentation and README files

## [0.5.0]

* Unified versioning across all fhir_r6 packages
* Updated dependencies

## [0.4.1]

* Updated dependencies

## [0.4.0]

* First time publishing this.
* Performs basic validation for FHIR resources

## [0.3.0]

* Most of the details are here https://fhir-fli.github.io/fhir_fli_documentation/docs

## [0.3.0-2]

* split back up into smaller packages, that seems to be how most people use it

## [0.3.0-1]

* Lots and Lots of changes.
* Once I get Mapping working properly, I'll create some actual documentation

## [0.2.0]

* Getting ready for FlutterCon!
* Updated dependencies
* Added documentation

## [0.1.0+2]

* Added ability to store versionIds as DataTimes instead of just integers (useful for syncing)
* Added a "sync" box in the Hive db. When turned on, saves all resources when updated, to allow easily finding them for syncing.
* Updated to work with updated primitives package (that has a lot more functionality with FhirBase)
* Added a deprecated parser to fhirpath for traversing tests

## [0.1.0+1]

* Overhaul. The packages were getting too big, and most people don't use all of them at the same time. So now, one package, all the functionality.
* Addressed [this issue](https://github.com/fhir-fli/fhir_at_rest/issues/2) pointed out by [fokusfpa](https://github.com/fokusfpa) - by just returning the OperationOutcome
* All FHIR dependencies should now be within this package.
* All dependencies updated except for collection, http_parser, and meta because there are some issues with the flutter version
