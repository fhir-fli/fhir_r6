# fhir_r6_cql

## [0.12.0]

- No code changes; version aligned with the fhir_r4 0.12.0 family release

## [0.9.0]

- No code changes; version aligned with the fhir_r6 0.9.0 family release

## [0.8.0]

- Carries the `memberOf` behavior change from fhir_r6_path ^0.8.0 — an invariant or expression using `memberOf` against a value set that cannot be resolved now throws rather than silently answering no. See the fhir_r6_path 0.8.0 entry
- fhir_r6 ^0.8.0

## [0.7.0]

- Family release train: cores and companions released in lockstep at 0.7.0
- Web/WASM compatible transitively (fhir_r6_path 0.7.0 removed the last dart:io in the dependency chain)
- fhir_r6 ^0.7.0, fhir_r6_path ^0.7.0

## [0.6.0]

- Rebuilt as a thin FHIR R6 binding over the model-independent [cql](https://pub.dev/packages/cql) engine: this package now provides the R6ModelResolver and R6TerminologyProvider implementations (and re-exports package:cql); the translator and engine themselves live in cql
- Family version lockstep: depends on cql ^0.6.0, fhir_r6 ^0.6.0, fhir_r6_path ^0.6.0, ucum ^0.9.0
- Rewrote README for the new architecture; removed stale engine-era docs

## [0.5.1]

- Improved documentation and README files

## [0.5.0]

* Unified versioning across all fhir_r6 packages
* Updated dependencies
* Initial publication to pub.dev
