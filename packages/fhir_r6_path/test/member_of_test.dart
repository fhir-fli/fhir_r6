/// Regression guard for `memberOf`, which asks one question: is this code a
/// member of this value set.
///
/// The spec words it as membership throughout — *"returns true if the code is
/// a member of the given valueset"*, *"returns true if any code in the concept
/// is a member of the given valueset"* — and says nothing about the code also
/// being valid in its own code system.
///
/// Two defects made that unanswerable, both fixed in the shared engine:
///
/// 1. Validation asked the wider "and valid in its code system" question. A
///    value set enumerating SNOMED concepts is answerable from the enumeration
///    alone, and SNOMED is licensed, so no offline deployment holds the code
///    system. The wider question answered `false` for a code the value set
///    plainly lists: a confident wrong answer, and a silent one.
/// 2. An unresolvable value set answered `false` (operator form) or empty
///    (function form), where the spec says an error is thrown. `false` says
///    the code is not in the set; what happened is that nobody could look.
///
/// The R4 copy of this file is the original; see its note on
/// `castToCodeableConcept`, which differs here — R6 accepts a `string` where
/// R4 does not.
