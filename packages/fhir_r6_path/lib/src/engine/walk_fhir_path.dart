/// Start here! This is where the fun begins. This is a bit confusing, so we'll
/// explain the arguments that can be passed.
///
/// The FHIRPath specification defines the following inputs:
///
/// **context**
///
/// [context](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/#environment-variables)
/// Is the original node that was passed to the evaluation engine before
/// starting evaluation.
///
/// Should always be passed in through the [context] parameter.
///
///
/// **resource**
///
/// [resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#variables)
/// the resource that contains the original node that is in %context
///
/// May be passed in either through an entry in the [environment] map,
/// named "%resource", or through the dedicated parameter.
/// A non-null dedicated parameter takes precedence.
///
///
/// **rootResource**
///
/// [rootResource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html#variables)
/// the container resource for the resource identified by %resource
///
/// May be passed in either through an entry in the [environment] map,
/// named "%rootResource", or through the dedicated parameter.
/// A non-null dedicated parameter takes precedence.
///
/// **environment variables / resources**
///
/// [environment] - arbitrary named environment variables.
/// These should be passed in as a map, where each key has the format
/// "%variable-name".
///
/// ```json
/// {
///   "%pi": 3.1415927,
///   "%myname": "Grey"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// *** Lazy-loading ***
/// Instead of a static value, the [environment] may map keys to functions
/// which return the actual value. These functions will only be evaluated when
/// the variable is accessed. This lazy evaluation may boost performance, for
/// instance when iif is used to determine which of two expensive objects is to
/// be used.
///
/// The lazy-loading mechanism is currently only supported through the
/// [environment] map, not for explicitly passed-in parameters.
