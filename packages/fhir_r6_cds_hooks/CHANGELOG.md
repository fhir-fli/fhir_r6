# fhir_r6_cds_hooks

## [Unreleased]

- The CDS Hooks code now lives in `fhir_cds_hooks` 0.13.0, which serves every
  FHIR version and carries resources as JSON. This package re-exports it and
  adds R6-typed views: `prefetchResources`, `typedResource`, and
  `draftOrdersBundle`-style getters on the hook contexts. `CdsRequest.prefetch`,
  `CdsAction.resource` and the contexts' bundle fields are `Map<String, dynamic>`
  (were `Resource`/`Bundle`); pass `resource.toJson()` in.
