## [0.5.0]

* Unified versioning across all fhir_r6 packages
* Updated dependencies
* Migrated from Hive to SQLite/Drift
* Added SQLCipher encryption support via sqlite3mc

## [0.4.0]

* Added id to xhtml _allowedAttributes
* Updated dependencies
* Simplified password handling: only required in `init()`
* Enhanced key derivation: Replaced static salt with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation using per-instance salt (100,000 iterations).
* Per-instance salt: each db instance now has a unique salt stored in `.fhir_db_salt` file, provides significantly stronger security against brute-force attacks.
* Improved error handling
* just update to use the most recent fhir_r6 package

## [0.3.0]

* Most of the details are here https://fhir-fli.github.io/fhir_fli_documentation/docs

## [0.3.0-2]

* split back up into smaller packages, that seems to be how most people use it

## [0.3.0-1]

* Lots and Lots of changes.
* Once I get Mapping working properly, I'll create some actual documentation

## [0.2.0]

* Getting ready for FlutterCon!
* Updated dependencies
* Added documentation

## [0.1.0+2]

* Added ability to store versionIds as DataTimes instead of just integers (useful for syncing)
* Added a "sync" box in the Hive db. When turned on, saves all resources when updated, to allow easily finding them for syncing.
* Updated to work with updated primitives package (that has a lot more functionality with FhirBase)
* Added a deprecated parser to fhirpath for traversing tests

## [0.1.0+1]

* Overhaul. The packages were getting too big, and most people don't use all of them at the same time. So now, one package, all the functionality.
* Addressed [this issue](https://github.com/fhir-fli/fhir_at_rest/issues/2) pointed out by [fokusfpa](https://github.com/fokusfpa) - by just returning the OperationOutcome
* All FHIR dependencies should now be within this package.
* All dependencies updated except for collection, http_parser, and meta because there are some issues with the flutter version
